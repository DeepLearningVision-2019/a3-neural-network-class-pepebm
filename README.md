# A3: Neural network class

Based on previous code examples, develop a neural network class that is able to classify any dataset provided. The class should create objects based on the desired network architecture:

1. Number of inputs
2. Number of hidden layers
3. Number of neurons per layer
4. Number of outputs
5. Learning rate

The class must have the train, and predict functions.

Test the neural network class on the datasets provided: Use the input data to train the network, and then pass new inputs to predict on. Print the expected label and the predicted label for the input you used. Print the accuracy of the training after predicting on different inputs.

Use matplotlib to plot the error that the train method generates.

**Rubric:**

1. The class constructor is correctly defined.
2. The train function contains the correct feed forward implementation.
3. The train function contains the correct back propagation implementation.
4. The predict function works as expected.
5. The class is used to train and predict the XOR data set.
6. The class is used to train and predict the multiple class data set.
7. The class is used to train and predict the mnist data set.
8. Both questions are answered.
